### Project Title

Tableau Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

### Description

In this project, I've implemented data visualizations utilizing a variety of charts and graphs in Tableau from a superstore dataset (superstore.csv). 

I've focused on answering the following business related questions: 

* Sales per month
* Sales per state
* Sales per profit bin
* Sales percentage per region
* Sales per category
* Quantity - Discount correlation

Key data analytic skills highlighted in the Tableau dashboard project include data transformation and processing, integration, visualization, and customization.
